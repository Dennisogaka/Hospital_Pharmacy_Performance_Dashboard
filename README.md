# Hospital_Pharmacy_Performance_in_Kenyan_Counties-2024 (Power BI Interactive Dashboard)
## Project Objective
The project aim was to look at the patterns across the Kenyan counties in regards to patient's visit and diagnosis. From the analysis insights are drawn to help key stakeholders in healthcare decision making in Kenya.

### Financial & Operational Key Metrics

- **Revenue Efficiency**: The average revenue per visit stands at approximately **KES 917**.

- **Inventory Cost Drivers**: **Malaria** and **Cold & Flu** treatments represent the highest expenditure. These two categories, along with **Diabetes**, account for the bulk of the pharmacy's procurement costs.

- **Peak Demand Cycles**: Patient volume is cyclical, with significant surges in **March** and **August**. These peaks suggest a need for seasonal inventory stockpiling to prevent stockouts during these windows.

### Patient Demographics & Resource Allocation
The pharmacy's primary "customers" are the **Elderly** and **Adult** populations, who consume more than double the quantity of medication compared to Children and Teenagers combined.

- **Elderly/Adult** Consumption Trend is Very High and the strategic focus should be on **Chronic disease management (Diabetes/Hypertension)**.

- **Children** Consumption Trend is Moderate and strategic focus should be on **Seasonal illness (Cold/Flu/Malaria)**.

- **Teenagers** Consumption Trend is Low and strategic focus should be on **Preventive care and acute treatment**.

### Regional Performance Analysis
Operational focus varies significantly by county, indicating different healthcare needs across the network:
- **Emergency Centers**: **Kisumu** and **Uasin Gishu** have the highest emergency caseloads. These locations require 24/7 pharmacist availability and high-alert medication readiness.

- **Inpatient Hub**: **Kiambu** is the clear leader in Inpatient visits. This facility likely requires a higher volume of bulk-dose medications and surgical supplies.

- **Outpatient Stability**: **Mombasa** and **Nairobi** maintain a more balanced distribution, suggesting a strong "retail" pharmacy model.

## Actionable Recommendations
- **Procurement**: Negotiate volume discounts for **Malaria** and **Cold/Flu** medications prior to the **March** and **August** peaks to protect margins.

- **Service Optimization**: Increase **geriatric pharmaceutical support** in high-volume regions to cater to the dominant Elderly demographic.

- **Resource Alignment**: Shift **emergency-trained staff** or **specialized inventory** toward the **Kisumu** and **Uasin Gishu** branches to meet the higher urgent care demand.
